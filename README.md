Lower Third Generator for Google Hangouts 
=================

Lower Third Generator for Google Hangouts is Licensed under GPL v2
===Requirements===
-PHP GD
-PHP 5 or better

===Installation===
Just upload it!

===Notes===
The Form that is included (form.php) is nothing special, it is a simple form, but note the vars!

===Adjustments===
This Simple Script generates a lower third for use with Hangout Toolbox!
The included image file is freezies and you can add your logo using Photoshop or GIMP, or just use it (hangouts.png)!
In the image.php file, edit the X/Y Cords for the top and bottom so the Text on the bar looks right, currently it is perfect
The included font (FreeSans) is GPL, you can change the font by changing the $fontPath var in image.php

===To Do===
I need to make better docs!

Chow!
